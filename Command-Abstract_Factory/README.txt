To compile the files use:

g++ -std=c++11 -I. *.cpp


You can use ./a.out < input.txt to run the data. 
If you created the math operations in the input.txt

Example input.txt:

1 + 2
4 - 5 % 7
2 - 3
4 * 7 / 3
quit

OR 
also can just run it in the terminal and 
And perform math operations there, then use 
"quit" to exit the program
